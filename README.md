KwaiRec is a real-world dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app Kwai. For now, it is the first dataset that contains a fully observed user-item interaction matrix. For the term "fully observed", we mean there are almost no missing values in the user-item matrix, i.e., each user has viewed each video and leaved feedback.
